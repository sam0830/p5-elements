         Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. The secret to doing anything is believing that you can do it. Anything that you believe you can do strong enough, you can do. Anything. As long as you believe. We'll put all the little clouds in and let them dance around and have fun. God gave you this gift of imagination. Use it.
